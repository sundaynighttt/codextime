# Codex app-server protocol

CodexTime does not open Codex authentication files. It starts `codex app-server` as a child process and communicates over JSONL using standard input and output.

## Request sequence

1. `initialize`
2. `initialized`
3. `account/rateLimits/read`

## Consumed response fields

- `rateLimitsByLimitId.codex.primary.usedPercent`
- `rateLimitsByLimitId.codex.primary.resetsAt`
- `rateLimitsByLimitId.*.limitName`
- `rateLimitsByLimitId.*.secondary`
- the backward-compatible `rateLimits` snapshot when the keyed map is absent

`resetsAt` is interpreted as Unix epoch seconds. `usedPercent` is clamped into a remaining percentage using `100 - usedPercent`.

The monitor launches a fresh child process for each network refresh and terminates it after receiving a response. It does not attach to the Codex Desktop app's existing app-server session.

## Compatibility boundary

`app-server` and `account/rateLimits/read` are experimental interfaces. CodexTime's parser ignores unrelated JSON-RPC notifications and initialization responses, but a renamed method or materially changed response shape will require a compatibility update.
